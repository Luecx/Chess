Contributed code should match these requirements:

<b>Variables</b>
1. variables should be defined as java-standard variables like `someRandomVariable` or `some_random_variable`
2. variable names should be unique
3. non-static variables should be made private including getters/setters 

<b>Methods</b>
1. naming methods should follow the same rule as naming variables
2. methods should include a javadoc which explains what the method does including the return values and arguments
